## About The Project
About the project </br>
<p>This project comprises of three programs which are made from python. They all produce the same result but through different processes, by utilising different functions and theories. </p>
<p>Version 1 uses a for loop inside a for loop, it uses a flag to mark a number as a prime number or otherwise. 
<p>Version 2 is very similar to the first version, however, it doesn't use a flag and instead uses a more memory saving method by replacing the flag with a simple selection statement. </p>
<p>Version 3 uses another method, it checks if a number is divisible by all of the prime numbers before it, this method has been mathematically proven to always prove a number is a prime, it uses less memory and has a faster time complexity since it doesn't go through every number in a list and only the primes.</p>
<p>Version 4 utilises the version 3 of the finding the prime number function and adds another function to add a GUI.</p>


## Getting Started
To start using the repository, you must clone the repository.
This can be done by installing Git and cloning the repository through terminal/commmand line.

## Cloning the repository
# MacOS
1. Open terminal.
2. Type in `brew install git`, if the command goes through, proceed to instruction 4, if it doesn't proceed to instruction 3.
3. If the command is rejected with an error, you must download depedencies required to use brew commands.
4. Now that you have Git, you are able to use Git commands, you can clone the repository by using the command `git clone https://github.com/fadyawan/Project_DAPI`

# Windows
1. Download Git for Windows, from https://gitforwindows.org/.
2. Open Git BASH or alternitively open Git CMD.
3. Type in the command line, "git clone https://github.com/fadyawan/Project_DAPI "

## Usage
This repository only contains programs that produces a list of the prime numbers between 0 and 100. By opening the source code and running it, the output is instantly displayed in either the console or the GUI, depending on the version used.
