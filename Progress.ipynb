    "About the project </br>\n",
    "<p>This project comprises of three programs which are made from python. They all produce the same result but through different processes, by utilising different functions and theories. </p>\n",
    "<p>Version 1 uses a for loop inside a for loop, it uses a flag to mark a number as a prime number or otherwise. \n",
    "<p>Version 2 is very similar to the first version, however, it doesn't use a flag and instead uses a more memory saving method by replacing the flag with a simple selection statement. </p>\n",
    "<p>Version 3 uses another method, it checks if a number is divisible by all of the prime numbers before it, this method has been mathematically proven to always prove a number is a prime, it uses less memory and has a faster time complexity since it doesn't go through every number in a list and only the primes.</p>\n",
    "<p>Version 4 utilises the version 3 of the finding the prime number function and adds another function to add a GUI.</p>"
